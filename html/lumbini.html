        <div class="about-content">
            <p>Lumbini, located in the Rupandehi District of Nepal, is one of the most revered pilgrimage sites for Buddhists across the world. It holds immense spiritual significance as the birthplace of Siddhartha Gautama, who later became the Buddha, the founder of Buddhism. According to tradition, Queen Maya Devi gave birth to Siddhartha in 623 BCE in a lush garden while she was en route to her parental home. Today, the <b>Maya Devi Temple</b> stands at the spot where this miraculous event is said to have taken place, with a sacred stone marking the birthplace. The temple is accompanied by the <b>Puskarini Pond</b>, where Queen Maya is believed to have bathed before the birth of the Buddha. As a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Lumbini is not only a religious and historical landmark but also a symbol of global peace. <br><br>The area is meticulously preserved, with lush greenery and tranquil gardens, making it a serene place for meditation and reflection. Visitors from around the globe come to Lumbini not just for spiritual reasons but also to experience its rich cultural heritage. The site features various international monasteries built by Buddhist communities from different countries, each reflecting their unique architectural styles and practices. These monasteries contribute to Lumbiniâ€™s diverse cultural landscape, making it a true representation of the unity within the global Buddhist community. <br><br> Additionally, the surrounding area includes other significant sites, such as the <b>Lumbini Museum</b>, which showcases the history and evolution of Buddhism. Lumbini serves as a reminder of the Buddha's teachings on compassion, peace, and enlightenment, inspiring people to live in harmony with themselves and others. It is a place where the lessons of the Buddha come to life, promoting spiritual growth and global unity.</p>
