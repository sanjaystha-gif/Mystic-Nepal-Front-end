        <div class="about-content">
            <p><b>Sagarmatha</b>, known internationally as <b>Mount Everest</b>, is the highest mountain in the world, standing at an astounding <b>8,848.86 meters</b> (29,031.7 feet) above sea level. Located in the <b>Himalayas</b> on the border between Nepal and the Tibet Autonomous Region of China, Sagarmatha is not only a geographical marvel but also a symbol of human endurance and determination. In Nepal, the mountain is referred to as <b>Sagarmatha</b>, which means "Forehead in the Sky" in Nepali, highlighting its towering presence above the clouds. <br><br>

                Sagarmatha holds great cultural and spiritual significance for the people of Nepal, particularly the <b>Sherpa community</b>, who live in the surrounding regions. For centuries, local communities have considered the mountain sacred, believing it to be the abode of the gods. The area around Sagarmatha is part of the <b>Sagarmatha National Park</b>, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which encompasses stunning landscapes, glaciers, and alpine forests. The park is home to unique wildlife such as the <b>snow leopard</b>, <b>red panda</b>, and various species of pheasants, adding to its ecological importance. <br><br>
                
                Climbing Sagarmatha is a dream for mountaineers worldwide, but it is also an incredibly challenging and dangerous feat. Since Sir <b>Edmund Hillary</b> of New Zealand and <b>Tenzing Norgay</b>, a Sherpa of Nepal, first reached the summit in 1953, the mountain has become a popular destination for trekkers and climbers. However, the extreme altitude, unpredictable weather, and physical demands make it a hazardous endeavor. <br><br>
                
                For trekkers, the <b>Everest Base Camp</b> trek provides an accessible way to experience the mountain's grandeur without summiting. The journey through the **Khumbu Valley** offers stunning views of the surrounding peaks and a chance to witness the unique Sherpa culture. Sagarmatha continues to inspire awe and reverence, drawing adventurers, nature lovers, and spiritual seekers from around the globe.</p>
